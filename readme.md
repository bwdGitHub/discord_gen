# gen
This is a mini-project to connect a [discord](https://discord.com/) bot to a [language model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model) so that it might generate interesting responses from a prompt.

## Dependencies
I'm using the following:
* [discord.py v1.3.3](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/)
* [transformers v2.6.0](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
* [Python v3.8.2](https://www.python.org/)

Of course these have their own dependencies, I'm not your package manager.

## Where's the code?
For now it's on the `dev` branch. I try to use `master` for stuff I'm confident about. Unfortunately `git` forces me to commit something, so I have to put this readme here.

## Disclaimer
This is for fun, it's not intended to be anything. There are probably many bots like this, but this one is mine.
